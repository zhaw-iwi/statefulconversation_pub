## Introduction

Stateful Prompt-Chaining is a framework designed to enhance the capabilities of language models in handling complex conversations and tasks in chatbot applications where the prompt dependencies and context matter. The idea behind this project is to improve LLM applications by breaking down complex tasks into smaller, better-testable subtasks.

## Project Overview

Stateful Prompt-Chaining aims to tackle these challenges by introducing a state-machine-based approach to chaining multiple LLM (Large Language Model) prompts together. This chaining mechanism simplifies the process of creating precise and testable prompts, while also leveraging external systems like databases to enrich the conversational capabilities. This setup shall also simplify a wide variety of other complex NLP tasks.

## Note

The framework is currently still in development and we plan to release the first functional version end of August 2023.

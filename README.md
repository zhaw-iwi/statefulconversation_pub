## Introduction

Stateful Prompt-Chaining is a framework designed to enhance the capabilities of large language models (LLM) in handling complex conversations and tasks in chatbot applications where the prompt dependencies and context matter. The idea behind this project is to improve LLM applications by breaking down complex tasks into smaller, better-testable subtasks.

## Project Overview

Stateful Prompt-Chaining aims to tackle these challenges by introducing a model-driven approach to chaining/branching/merging multiple LLM prompts together. This chaining mechanism simplifies the process of creating precise and testable prompts, while also leveraging external systems like databases to enrich the conversational capabilities. This setup will also simplify a variety of other complex NLP tasks such as de-biasing natural language texts.

## Note

The framework is currently still in development as part of multiple projects currently running. We will release a public version once its main concepts will be published.
